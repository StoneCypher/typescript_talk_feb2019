# What is Typescript

It's <span class="red">type annotations</span>.

```
const someNum = 5,
      theBool = false,
      aString = 'Bob Dobbs',
      myArray = [ 1, 'two', 3 ],

      myObj   = { one: 1, two: 2 },

      myFun   = num => num * 2;
```

becomes

```
const someNum : number        = 5,
      theBool : boolean       = false,
      aString : string        = 'Bob Dobbs',
      myArray : array         = [ 1, 'two', 3 ],
      myIntAr : array<number> = [ 1, 2, 3 ],
      myObj   : object        = { one: 1, two: 2 },

      myFun   = num => num * 2;

Statistically significant differences were found between language class and paradigm.

Statically typed languages resulted in an 8% reduction in defects vs dynamic.

Languages used functionally resulted in a 19% reduction in defects vs procedural imperative.

These benefits rapidly get stronger as the team size grows.
