# TL;DR: Nutshell trapdoor, pg 1

<br/>
Purity means working without side effects.  Functions take input only from arguments, output only
through return values, and always give the same result for the same arguments.  Don't change your
objects, don't keep local state, don't modify closure state, don't return objects with mutable
backhooks.

Absolute purity isn't possible in Javascript, because there's no way to fully encapsulate events, IO,
and so on, but you can get arbitrarily close, and it's useful.

In particular, things that never have side effects can be safely snapped together without regard to
how their internals work, allowing a more carefree style of programming that also reads better.  Some
of the idioms thereof, like what Javascript people call "fluent interfaces," are examples of what's
under the hood.

# TL;DR: Nutshell trapdoor, pg 2

<br/>
Building things progressively out of small pieces - composition - is more convenient in the
constraints of a functional environment than most places, and so people tend towards it.

Being able to work purely is also a threshhold before being able to get serious about functional
programming, which is becoming more prevalent in ES6 and ES8, and which leads to cleaner, easier to
reason about code.

For the next 20 minutes, I'm going to prattle at you about purity and composability, and why you
should care.

# What is Purity

- It just means "programming without side effects"

<br/>
## Fine, then what the hell are side effects

- Side effects are changes to local or global state
  - Changing a persistent variable?  Side effect.
  - Modifying an argument?  Side effect.
  - Loading from disk or network?  Side effect.

These things are easily avoided.

In general, <span class="red">if you can call a function with the same arguments, but get a different result</span>,
it's because of side effects.

In general, if you can call a function with the same arguments, but get a different result,
it's because of side effects.

Pure code is more like math: `f(x)` always does the same thing.  That means there's less to think
about, <span class="red">which makes reasoning easier</span>.

Impure

```javascript
var counter = 0;
function move_counter(by) { counter += by; return counter; }
```

This is impure because, within the function, we change state that lives outside of the function.  This means that if we call the function repeatedly with
the same value, we'll get different results:

```
move_counter(3); // 3
move_counter(3); // 6
move_counter(3); // 9
```
